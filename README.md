### AutoLoggerPoEPlus - Tamper-Proof Proof-of-Existence Logger
# Overview

`AutoLoggerPoEPlus` is an enhanced Proof-of-Existence (PoE) smart contract that securely logs digital content hashes on-chain. It provides tamper-proof, gasless, and fork-safe logging with full EIP-712 compliance.
This contract serves as a drop-in upgrade to the original `AutoLoggerPoE` and introduces critical improvements such as gasless signature-based logging, chain-aware digest recomputation, and domain introspection.
